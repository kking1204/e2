# Project 2
+ By: *Kenyon M King*

## Game planning
* I define a variable ($throw) that contains 'rocks', 'paper' 'scissors'
* I then define two variables, PlayerAMove and PlayerBMove. 
* PlayerAMove chooses a string at random from the $throw variable: 'rocks' (0), 'paper' (1) or 'scissors' (2)
* PlayerBMove chooses a string at random from the $throw variable: 'rocks' (0), 'paper' (1) or 'scissors' (2)
* Using conditional logic, I'll declare the winner (in new variable $winner) based on our understanding of rock beating scissors, etc.
* On index.php page load, I'll display what Player A threw, and what Player B threw, and who the winner is.

## Outside resources
* I used the lecture notes that linked to PHP.net
* I used the W3C HTML validator

## Notes for instructor
At the end, I spruced up the HTML page with some basic colors and styles. I added a sentece that reads "Refresh the page to play again!" - I'm aware that the project specified no user input required, but it doesn't involve any PHP programming on my part. I think it's kosher to leave it in? Thanks!
