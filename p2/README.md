# Project 2

## Game planning
* I define a variable ($throw) that contains 'rocks', 'paper' 'scissors'
* I then define two variables, PlayerAMove and PlayerBMove. 
* PlayerAMove chooses a string at random from the $throw variable: 'rocks' (0), 'paper' (1) or 'scissors' (2)
* PlayerBMove chooses a string at random from the $throw variable: 'rocks' (0), 'paper' (1) or 'scissors' (2)
* Using conditional logic, I'll declare the winner (in new variable $winner) based on our understanding of rock beating scissors, etc.
* On index.php page load, I'll display what Player A threw, and what Player B threw, and who the winner is.

## Outside resources
I used the lecture notes that linked to PHP.net
