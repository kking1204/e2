*Answer the following questions in regards to the student's project you are reviewing. Include code snippets in your answers when relevant.*


### Are you able to produce any errors or unexpected results? 

I was surprised that no answer submitted resulted in a 'wrong' answer

### Referencing the course nots on [Form design flow](https://hesweb.dev/e2/notes#/php/form-flow), describe the form design flow used in this project.

This is [Design C](https://hesweb.dev/e2/notes#/php/form-flow?jump=design-c).  Kudos! That's the most dificult one. I submitted Design A out of an abundance of caution. Did not have time to attempt it again using Design C and a SESSION.

### Are there any separation of concern issues (i.e. non-display specific logic in view files, display code in controller files)? 

No, this is super clean and orderly

### Are there aspects of the code that you feel were not self-evident and would benefit from comments?

The if / else logic was very straightforward in both the index.php and index-controller.php files

### List any/all built-in PHP methods used with a brief summary of what the method does

the $_GET superglobal method is used to get the user's submitted answer, it is stored in the $_SESSION superglobal. 

### Are there any parts of the code that you found interesting or taught you something new?

No, but I appreciated its brevity and cleanliness.

### Are there any parts of the code that you don't understand?

No, there were no curveballs. 

### Are there any best practices discussed in course material that you feel were not addressed in the code?

No, control and presentation were separated.

### Do you have any additional comments not covered in the above questions?

The clean and concise code made this a pleasure to review.
