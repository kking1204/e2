+ I used Bootstrap for CSS

## Notes for instructor
I got it _very_ close to how I wanted it. I was unable to get the results to display on the index page after the user clicks Submit. The best I could do was to get it to dump the results. It's ugly, but it gives the user their feedback. I don't know if another day/week would've helped me. I think it's just one of those stubborn things I couldn't wrap my brain around. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Another student had a [similar issue](https://github.com/susanBuck/e2-fall19/issues/118) in the forums, and I tried to understand it but I think I just just ran out of little grey cells.  You can see my pseudo code in lines 35-38 of my [index.blade.php file](https://github.com/kking1204/e2/blob/fc36df72026d72c6a6beced995697acebee1fb25/p4/views/index.blade.php) 

The rest was fun! I believe that the other requirements of the assignment have been met.
